### Introduction

The Library Management System is a backend application developed in Node.js for managing books in a library. It includes features for user registration, authentication, book management, borrowing and returning books, search functionality, and a simple recommendation system.

### Installation

#### Prerequisites

Before you can run the application, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- MongoDB (NoSQL database)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

#### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shashanksb17/indi-gg
cd library-management-system
```

#### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Configuration

#### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and configure the following environment variables:

```env
PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost/library-management-system
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
```

- `PORT`: The port on which the application will run.
- `MONGODB_URI`: The MongoDB connection URI.
- `SECRET_KEY`: A secret key for JWT token generation.

#### Database Setup

Ensure that your MongoDB server is running, and the `MONGODB_URI` in your `.env` file points to the correct MongoDB instance.

### Usage

#### Starting the Application

Start the application by running the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```

The application will start, and you can access it at `http://localhost:3000` or the port you specified in your `.env` file.

#### API Documentation with Swagger

Access the API documentation using Swagger UI at `http://localhost:3000/api-docs` after starting the application.

#### User Registration

- Use the `/api/auth/register` endpoint to register a new user by providing a name, email, and password in the request body.

#### User Login

- Authenticate users using the `/api/auth/login` endpoint by providing their email and password. A JWT token will be returned upon successful login.

#### Book Management

- Use the `/api/books` endpoints to add, update, delete, or list books in the library.

#### Borrowing & Returning Books

- Users can borrow a book using the `/api/borrow/:bookId` endpoint, and they can return a book using the `/api/return/:bookId` endpoint.

#### Search Functionality

- Users can search for books by title, author, or ISBN using the `/api/search` endpoint.

#### Recommendation System

- Get personalized book recommendations for a user by using the `/api/recommendations/:userId` endpoint.


### Error Handling

The application handles errors gracefully and provides appropriate error messages in the response for various scenarios.


This is a basic template for documenting your Library Management System. You can expand on each section as needed, provide detailed API endpoints, request examples, and more, depending on the complexity and requirements of your application.
